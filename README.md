# Data Analytics Intern Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends using various datasets. The analysis focuses on identifying popular dishes, exploring demographic factors influencing user behavior, and examining the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights to optimize menu offerings, improve marketing strategies, and enhance session quality.

The datasets were cleaned, merged, and analyzed to extract valuable insights.
