# Data Analytics Intern Project Report

## Project Overview
The aim of this project was to analyze user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends using data from cooking sessions, user details, and order details. The analysis aimed to identify popular dishes, explore demographic factors affecting user behavior, and understand the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders.

## Data Description
The project uses three main datasets:
- **UserDetails**: Information about users, including demographics, favorite meals, and total number of orders.
- **CookingSessions**: Details of cooking sessions, including session ratings, durations, and the meal type.
- **OrderDetails**: Order information, including the dish name, order amount, status, and session ID.

The datasets were cleaned and merged to provide a unified dataset for analysis.

## Key Analysis and Insights

### 1. Popular Dishes
The top 10 most popular dishes were identified based on total order counts. The most frequently ordered dishes provide valuable insights for optimizing the menu and catering to user preferences.

**Key Insight**: Popular dishes like Spaghetti and Caesar Salad showed up consistently as top orders. This suggests a preference for certain dishes, which can inform menu design and promotions.

### 2. Age and Order Behavior
The analysis of average order amounts across different age groups revealed insights into spending patterns. Younger users tend to spend less per order compared to older age groups.

**Key Insight**: Users aged 30-50 showed the highest average spending on orders. Marketing efforts can target this age group with premium offerings.

### 3. Orders by Location
The data was analyzed by location to identify the regions with the highest order volume. Locations with higher orders can be targeted for localized campaigns or regional promotions.

**Key Insight**: Locations such as New York and Los Angeles had the highest number of orders, suggesting these areas might be ideal targets for promotional activities.

### 4. Favorite Meal vs Total Orders
Meal preferences (breakfast, lunch, dinner) were analyzed to understand user behavior. This can guide businesses to tailor offers based on meal-time preferences.

**Key Insight**: Dinner was the most ordered meal, followed by lunch, suggesting that offering special dinner promotions could increase sales.

### 5. Session Ratings and Total Orders
The analysis examined how session ratings correlated with the total number of orders. Higher-rated sessions tend to result in more orders, highlighting the importance of quality cooking sessions in driving order volume.

**Key Insight**: Cooking sessions with ratings above 4 consistently correlated with higher order numbers, suggesting that high-quality sessions lead to greater customer satisfaction and repeat orders.

### 6. Session Duration and Orders
The relationship between session duration and the number of orders was explored. Longer sessions did not necessarily correlate with higher order volumes, indicating that session quality might be more important than duration.

**Key Insight**: Shorter, more focused cooking sessions with higher ratings tended to result in more orders. Optimizing session times could lead to more efficient cooking and order fulfillment.

## Business Recommendations

### 1. Optimize Menu Based on Popular Dishes
- Focus on promoting the most popular dishes, particularly Spaghetti and Caesar Salad, which could be featured in marketing campaigns and special offers.
- Consider offering variations or specials around these dishes to keep customer interest high.

### 2. Target Specific Age Groups with Tailored Offers
- Given the higher spending by users aged 30-50, create targeted promotions that appeal to this demographic, such as premium meal options or family-sized servings.
- Consider offering discounts or loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases from younger users.

### 3. Focus on High-Order Locations for Regional Promotions
- Since regions like New York and Los Angeles have the highest order volumes, consider running region-specific marketing campaigns or opening additional outlets in these areas to capture more demand.

### 4. Time-Based Marketing for Meal Preferences
- Dinner is the most popular meal, so consider offering time-based promotions or discounts during peak dinner hours to increase order volume.
- Offer special lunch or breakfast combos to tap into the second most ordered meal times.

### 5. Improve Session Quality for Better Customer Engagement
- Focus on improving session ratings by maintaining high quality in cooking sessions. Training chefs and improving session efficiency could lead to more orders.
- Offer incentives or rewards to customers who rate sessions highly to encourage them to return.

### 6. Optimize Session Duration
- Based on the findings, shorter sessions that maintain high quality seem to perform better. Streamlining the cooking process to ensure quality without unnecessary delays could result in more orders.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and preferences. The findings can help businesses optimize their offerings, target the right demographic, and improve customer satisfaction. By focusing on the quality of cooking sessions, regional preferences, and popular menu items, businesses can drive increased sales and customer loyalty.
